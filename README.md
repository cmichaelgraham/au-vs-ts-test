## Running The App

To run the tests, follow these steps.

1. Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is installed. This provides the platform on which the build tooling runs.
2. From the project folder, execute the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```
4. Ensure that [jspm](http://jspm.io/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install -g jspm
  ```
5. Install the client-side dependencies with jspm:

  ```shell
  jspm install
  ```
6. To view the tests in Visual Studio, open the solution with Visual Studio 2003, Update 4:

## Running The Tests

To run the unit tests, first ensure that you have followed the steps above in order to install all dependencies and successfully build the library. Once you have done that, proceed with these additional steps:

1. Ensure that the [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) CLI is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install -g karma-cli
  ```
2. You can now run the tests with this command:

  ```shell
  karma start
  ```

  You can edit the tests in Visual Studio.  When you save, karma is watching the test files to detect changes and will re-run the tests.  You will see test results (successes & failures) in the shell.
